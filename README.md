<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="readme-assets/screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot">

There are many envelope budgeting systems, digital and physical, that can help you get a handle on your finances.  The tactile nature of physical systems (using cash and actual labeled envelopes), really lends itself to increasing intentionality with spending money.  Literally taking money out of a 'savings'/envelope seems to help accountability.

However, personally, I identified some challenges:

* One challenge was the mobility of such a system; in many cases, it wasn't the most agile setup.
* Unless you kept a written balance on the envelope, you couldn't see how much you had left without opening the envelope.
* Was there a way to see performance metrics at a glance?

#### Metrics


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

*It would be great to further flesh out the 'Metrics' section, certaintly additonal information can be extracted from the data to benefit our productivity.

*General UX is an ongoing project.
